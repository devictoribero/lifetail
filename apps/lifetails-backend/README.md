# Lifetails Backend

Lifetails is a backend application for managing pet lifecycle events and information, structured according to Domain-Driven Design principles and implemented with a modern architecture approach.

## Architecture

The Lifetails backend is built following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The codebase is organized around business domains, with clear boundaries between different contexts. Each domain has its own models, repositories, and services, promoting high cohesion and low coupling.

- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: The application separates read and write operations. Commands change the state of the system while queries retrieve data without side effects.

- **GraphQL API**: Use cases are exposed via GraphQL queries and mutations, providing a flexible API that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Queries map to read operations, while mutations map to commands that modify data.

The architecture promotes:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Scalability and maintainability
- Domain integrity and business rule enforcement
- Independent evolution of different bounded contexts

## Coding Style

The project follows an object-oriented programming paradigm:

- **Classes and Interfaces**: Core domain concepts are modeled as classes with well-defined interfaces
- **Encapsulation**: Data and behavior are encapsulated within appropriate domain objects
- **Dependency Injection**: Used extensively to promote testability and loose coupling
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that model concepts with no identity
- **Entities**: Objects with identity that can change over time
- **Repositories**: Handle persistence concerns separated from domain logic
