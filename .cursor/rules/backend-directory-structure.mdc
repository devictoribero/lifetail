# Directory Structure

## Rationale
Maintaining a consistent, layered directory structure is critical for readability, scalability, and developer onboarding. This rule enforces separation of concerns through clearly defined directories aligned with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and layered architecture principles.

## Rule
The application must follow the layered architecture pattern and organize its code under the following top-level directories:

- src/ (Root source directory containing all application code)
  - contexts/ (Organizes code by business domains/bounded contexts)
    - Lifetails/ (Main bounded context for the pet lifecycle application)
      - [module]/ (Domain-specific module, e.g., Authentication, Pets, Users)
        - application/ (Use cases and application services for this module)
          - [commandHandler]/ (Specific use case implementation)
            - [commandHandler]Command.ts (DTO defining the data needed for the write operation)
            - [commandHandler]CommandHandler.spec.ts (Tests for the command handler logic)
            - [commandHandler]CommandHandler.ts (Business logic for this use case of write operations)
          - [queryHandler]/ (Specific use case implementation)
            - [queryHandler]Query.ts (DTO defining the data needed for the read operation)
            - [queryHandler]QueryHandler.spec.ts (Tests for the query handler logic)
            - [queryHandler]QueryHandler.ts (Business logic for this use case of read operations)
        - domain/ (Core business logic and rules for this module)
          - entities/ (Business objects with identity and lifecycle)
          - value-objects/ (Business objects represnting concepts)
          - exceptions/ (Domain-specific error definitions)
          - repositories/ (Interfaces defining data access contracts)
          - services/ (Stateless domain operations and business rules)
        - infrastructure/ (External dependencies implementation for this module)
      - Shared/ (Cross-cutting concerns and utilities shared across domains)
  - server/ (API server configuration and endpoints)
    main.ts (Server bootstrap and configuration)
    lifetails.gql (Generated GraphQL schema)
    - graphql/ (GraphQL schema definitions and resolvers)
    - modules/ (NestJS modules configuration)

Each directory must be present if it is relevant to the application's scope.

## Best Practices
- Each module represents an aggregate root.
- Keep layers **independent**. The domain layer should not depend on application or infrastructure.
- Avoid mixing concerns (e.g., no business logic inside controllers).
- Place shared code (e.g., types, constants) in clearly named `shared/` folders at the layer-appropriate level.
